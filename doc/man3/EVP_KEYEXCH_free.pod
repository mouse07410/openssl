=head1 NAME

EVP_KEYEXCH_free, EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref
- Functions to manage EVP_KEYEXCH algorithm objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 void EVP_KEYEXCH_free(EVP_KEYEXCH *exchange);
 int EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref(EVP_KEYEXCH *exchange);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_KEYEXCH_free() decrements the reference count for the B<EVP_KEYEXCH>
structure. Typically this structure will have been obtained from an earlier call
to L<EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch(3)>. If the reference count drops to 0 then the
structure is freed.

EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref() increments the reference count for an B<EVP_KEYEXCH>
structure.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref() returns 1 for success or 0 otherwise.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

The functions described here were added in OpenSSL 3.0.
